As of evening of 18/07/20:

Features my Hogwarts missing:
- 2 routes associated with skills and edit student route
- Validations
- Admin user implimentation
- Milestone 4

Features that I have implemented but are not working correctly:
- DataLayer:
	- receive students and receive students as json - not sure I understood the objective
	- persist students corrupts json file with escape characters "\" for some reason
- Student:
	- not sure if inherited from dict correctly

In genereal I dont yet have clear understanding of how all the components of CRM should be
integrated together and everything working properly with single instance of data layer.
